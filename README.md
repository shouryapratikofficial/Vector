## üìú Description

This project provides a hands-on way to understand how different graph traversal algorithms work. Users can interact with a grid to create obstacles ("walls") and then visualize how an algorithm explores the grid to find the shortest path between a start and finish node. It's a powerful educational tool for seeing the efficiency and logic of these fundamental computer science algorithms in action.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Interactive Grid:** Click and drag to draw walls and create custom mazes.
-   **Real-time Visualization:** Watch the algorithms explore nodes and draw the shortest path with smooth animations.
-   **Multiple Algorithms:** Implements both Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* Search algorithm.
-   **Performance Comparison:** A statistics panel displays the number of nodes visited and the final path length, clearly showing the efficiency difference between algorithms.
-   **Responsive UI:** A clean and simple interface with controls to run visualizations and clear the board.

## üß† Algorithms Implemented

-   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A classic algorithm that guarantees the shortest path by exploring in all directions equally. It's great for understanding the fundamentals of graph traversal.
-   **A\* Search:** A "smarter" and more efficient algorithm that uses a heuristic (an educated guess) to prioritize its search in the direction of the goal node.
